# Petit controleur
Simple and basic project to control temperature of fermenting beer ( as a homebrewer, this is crucial to good beer) with a on/off actuator toggling the beer fridge.

## Features
- Simple temperature control: set one temperature and the actuator will respond +/- 1 degree celsius
- Stepped temperature control: Set different temperatures with times and the control will step these when the moment comes. Still WIP

## Using:
- Nodemcu V1
- Temperature sensors DS18B20 and Relays
- HTML interface with bootstrap.
